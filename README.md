Natural Language Host-Based Indicators Malware Extraction Utility
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The `malware.py` module creates a `MalwareSample` object given a path to a PE32 binary executable file that has extracted section names, imported and exported symbols, filenames, urls, and strings (minus strings containing anything already extracted) from the binary file as fields/properties.

The `getNLindicators.py` module creates a list of `MalwareSample` objects and feeds this list (one object at a time) to the `process_malware_sample()` function.

Currently that processing function only has one additional call&mdash;that to `extract_nl_text()`. `extract_nl_text()` iterates through a `MalwareSample` object's `strings` property/field and tokenizes strings containing natural language text, using WordNet to identify whether tokens in the string are valid English-language words or not. A list of tokenized strings is returned (which is a list of lists). The intent is for these tokenized strings containing natural language text to be used as host-based indicators for malware, perhaps after additional natural language processing or computational linguistic analysis is performed.
